# About

My name is Dharma Bellamkonda. I'm a twentysomething living in Utah.

## Professional Life

I am a software engineer. Currently, I'm a Senior Cloud Engineer at
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com). I'm a maintainer on the Project Ethos
infrastructure, which is the multi-cloud Kubernetes distribution on which a
majority of Adobe's services run. 

Previously, I was a Linux Engineer at [Maverik](https://www.maverik.com) where
I was responsible for and automated the maintenance of the company's Linux
systems.

## Hobbies

I'm an avid adventure motorcyclist. I enjoy touring by motorcycle and
[motocamping](http://reddit.com/r/motocamping). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
I traveled on at least one multi-thousand-mile motorcycle tour each year. I
also do most of my own wrenching and maintain [technical documentation on my
BMW F750GS](https://github.com/dharmab/bmw-f750gs-f850gs).

I collect watches. Favorites in my collection include a [Monta
Oceanking](https://montawatch.com/collections/oceanking/products/oceanking-60-minute-bezel),
a [Dan Henry
1964](https://danhenrywatches.com/products/1964-gran-turismo-chronograph) and a
trusty Casio G-Shock.

I play skeet and have a casual competition shooting group.

I like to combine photography with my other hobbies.

I'm also into the usual nerdy range of hobbies: tabletop and board games, video
games, books and podcasts, comic books/manga/manhua.
