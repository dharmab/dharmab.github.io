# About

My name is Dharma Bellamkonda. I'm a twentysomething living in Utah.

## Professional Life

I am a software engineer. Currently, I'm a Senior Cloud Engineer at
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com). I'm a maintainer on the Project Ethos
infrastructure, which is the multi-cloud [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
distribution on which a majority of Adobe's services run. 

Previously, I was a Linux Engineer at [Maverik](https://www.maverik.com) where
I was responsible for and automated the maintenance of the company's Linux
systems.

## Hobbies

I'm an avid adventure motorcyclist. I enjoy touring by motorcycle and
[motocamping](http://reddit.com/r/motocamping).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I traveled on at least one interstate
motorcycle tour each year.

I also do most of my own wrenching and maintain [technical documentation on my
BMW F750GS](https://github.com/dharmab/bmw-f750gs-f850gs).

I collect watches. Favorites in my collection include a [Monta
Oceanking](https://montawatch.com/collections/oceanking/products/oceanking-60-minute-bezel),
a [Dan Henry
1964](https://danhenrywatches.com/products/1964-gran-turismo-chronograph) and a
trusty Casio G-Shock.

I play skeet and have a casual competition shooting group.

I like to combine photography with my other hobbies. I shoot with a [Fujifilm
mirrorless camera](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-a5),
usually with a
[prime](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf35mmf2-r-wr) or [wide
angle](https://www.rokinon.com/lenses/digital-photo-lenses/12mm-f20) lens. I
really enjoy taking photos while camping or hiking, although I still have a lot
to learn.

I'm a fan of [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org). I have a [git repo with
my configuration](https://github.com/dharmab/ansible-archlinux) and an
[ArchWiki user page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/User:Dharmab).

I'm also into the usual nerdy range of hobbies: tabletop and board games, video
games, books and podcasts, comic books/manga/manhua, electronic music.
